# Receipt_OCR
This project is written in Python and utilizes three different libraries: OpenCV, Tesseract, and Flask. The objective is to create an OCR tool that can extract data from a receipt and transform it into JSON format.

Flask is utilized to create an API that can be tested using tools like Postman, or can be integrated into an application. However, the current implementation does not include a public server for use.
